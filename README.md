##  About Me

I’m not just a developer—I’m a storyteller in JavaScript, a designer of digital dreams, and a realist who turns imagination into interaction. Every pixel, every line of code, and every word I craft has a purpose—to make people feel, think, and connect. From futuristic chatbots to immersive web experiences, my work lies at the intersection of creativity, logic, and emotion. Whether it's painting ideas with code or sculpting meaning through UI, I build not for today—but for the world we're about to step into.
